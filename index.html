      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What Is Photo Blending and Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>When photographing real estate, scenes often include a broad range of brightness levels: bright windows or skies, darker interiors, mixed lighting sources. A single exposure rarely captures all detail without either blowing out the highlights or losing shadows. Blending techniques solve this by merging multiple exposures or selectively combining different image parts to deliver balanced lighting, accurate color, and greater perceived quality. According to “The Blending Technique in Editing Real Estate Photos,” such techniques allow better color correction, exposure balance, and more realistic final visuals. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>
      <p>This article walks through major blending methods, workflows, tools, examples, and ethical considerations to help you produce or evaluate blended real estate images in 2025.</p>

    <!-- Types of Blending -->
    <section id="types-of-blending">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Main Types of Blending Techniques</h2>
      <div class="space-y-8">

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">1. HDR Blending (High Dynamic Range)</h3>
          <p>This is one of the most common methods. It involves capturing multiple bracketed shots (underexposed, correctly exposed, overexposed) and merging them so that highlights aren't blown out (e.g., bright sky or windows) and shadows retain texture. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">2. Manual Exposure Blending</h3>
          <p>Instead of relying solely on automatic HDR tools, manual blending lets you decide exactly which parts from each exposure to include. Usually done in Photoshop (or other layer-masking tools). This provides more control over lighting transitions and avoids some unnatural HDR artifacts. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">3. Window Pulls & Flash-Ambient Blending</h3>
          <p>Exterior views through windows often become overexposed. With window pulls, you use a darker exposure for the window view and blend it into the interior shot, preserving the view while keeping interior detail. Flash-ambient blending similarly combines ambient light with flash to brighten interiors while maintaining natural illumination. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>
        </div>

    <!-- Blending Workflow -->
    <section id="workflow">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Step-by-Step Workflow for Blending Real Estate Photos</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-5">

        <li><strong>Plan & Shoot Bracketed Exposures:</strong> Capture at least 3 exposures—one that preserves the sky or window detail (darker), one neutral, and one for shadows. Use a tripod for alignment. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>
        <li><strong>Import & Align:</strong> Load exposures into your software (Lightroom, Photoshop, Photomatix, etc.), align them to avoid ghosting or shifts. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>
        <li><strong>Create Masks / Layer Blend:</strong> Use layer masks to composite the best parts of each exposure. For example, use the darker exposure for windows, the mid for interiors, etc. For fine control, use luminosity masks or gradient masks. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust White Balance & Color Tone:</strong> Match color across exposures so that there’s no color shift. Balance temperature/tint so interiors and exterior look harmonious. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>
        <li><strong>Fine Tuning & Retouching:</strong> Address noise in darker exposures, sharpen critical details, correct lens distortion or perspective issues, and clean up edges. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
        <li><strong>Export & Quality Check:</strong> Review final image at 100% for artifacts, verify consistency across ordering of images in the gallery, ensure file size and format are appropriate for web or publication. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</li>
      </ol>

    <!-- Benefits of Blending -->
    <section id="benefits">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Blending Improves Real Estate Photos</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4">
        <li><strong>Balanced Lighting Appearance:</strong> Neither highlights (windows/sky) nor shadows lose detail; both are visible. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}</li>
        <li><strong>More Realistic Representation:</strong> Homes look more natural, which increases viewer trust. Overly HDRed or blown-out images can seem fake. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight Property Features:</strong> Details like textures, fixtures, architectural lines stand out when lighting is balanced. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}</li>
        <li><strong>Higher Engagement & Market Value:</strong> Listings with high-quality visuals often get more clicks, showings, and can sell for higher price. The source “The Blending Technique in Editing Real Estate Photos” claims expert editing increases perceived value. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}</li>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Over-Blending</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4">
        <li><strong>Over-processed HDR look:</strong> Saturation too high, halos around windows, unnatural contrast. Strive for realism. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}</li>
        <li><strong>Ghosting / Misalignment:</strong> Moving elements between exposures (trees, curtains, people) can cause ghost artifacts. Use masking or choose exposures carefully. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}</li>
        <li><strong>Color shifts/inconsistencies:</strong> Different exposures often have slight WB differences; blending without correction can cause odd hues. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}</li>
        <li><strong>Excessive cropping:</strong> After alignment and distortion correction, you may need to crop edges. Make sure you preserve composition. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}</li>

        <div class="bg-white shadow rounded p-6">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Interior Rooms with Bright Windows</h3>
          <p>For example, in living rooms with large windows the exterior view is often blown out in a single exposure. Blending a darker exposure for the view and a well-lit interior exposure keeps both visible. “Manual Blending Real Estate Photos in Photoshop” outlines this exact case. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}</p>
        </div>
